<h2>ChipIt</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>

Create a directory of _"Chips"_, each _Chip_ representing some topic/concept/idea. Each _Chip_ is represented by some form of "media" file (image, video, audio), PDF, or URL. Much like the file system on a computer but more visual and interactive. The idea came from personal reflection on study-habits and how to aid them.

The unique twist, was to make the file structure more dynamic by allowing active drawing on images, highlighting and circling areas of interest which could then link to other _Chips_ going into greater detail on the area - akin to Wikipedia's pervasive hyperlinks. Pictures tell a thousand words, quite literally.

**Status**: **On Hold**. The app was developing alongside my programming abilities, so is riddled with inconsistencies and bad practices. Addressing those issues is a large undertaking, that will be circled back to at a later time.

**Note: The app is not currently functioning. Old code was made obsolete by latest Android updates**.
