<h2>ChipIt</h2>

**Status**: abandonded. First, similar apps exist on the market. Second, project was built as I was learning, so the code-base is unnecessarily big and clunky due to poor practices. Addressing those issues is a large undertaking, so I chalked it off as an educational experience that has served its purpose.

**Note**: The app is not currently functioning. Android updates made a lot of the code outdated -- attempts at updating it quickly became too time-consuming. Will maybe hammer everything together to serve as a functioning show-piece but will be just for posterity. 

<h2>Goal</h2>

To create a directory of _"Chips"_, each _Chip_ representing some topic/concept/idea. Each _Chip_ is represented by some form of "media" file (image, video, audio), PDF, or URL. Much like the file system on a computer but more visual and interactive. The idea came from personal reflection on study-habits and how to aid them.

The unique twist, was to make the file structure more dynamic by allowing active drawing on images, highlighting and circling areas of interest which could then link to other _Chips_ going into greater detail on the area - akin to Wikipedia's pervasive hyperlinks. Pictures tell a thousand words, quite literally.
